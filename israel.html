      <ul>
          <li>Perched atop a rugged plateau overlooking the Dead Sea, Masada stands as a symbol of Jewish resistance and resilience. 
              The ancient fortress, built by King Herod the Great, became a last stronghold against Roman conquest in 73 CE. 
              Its dramatic tale of defiance and tragedy culminated in a mass suicide of its Jewish defenders rather than surrender. 
              Today, Masada's archaeological remains continue to stir debates among historians about the events that unfolded within 
              its formidable walls and the enduring legacy of its inhabitants.</li>
